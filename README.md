# Game-Theory--Finding-Approximate-Nash-Equilibria
 This is a program that uses python and various algorithms (DMP, DEL, FPUNIFORM, FPPBR) to find the aproximate nash equilibria in a random game generated. The user can either choose to create the games from the beginning (random) or to load them into the program (by having the payoff matrices for the row and column player in the path). He can also run all the algorithms or each one alone and produce in the end the eps approximate and eps well supported to see if the algorithm or algorithms were successful and how much.
 
- The R and C files present in the folder are provided for testing reasons and to test the function of loading file. There is a function of the program that detects if there are already R and C files in the folder and asks if these are the files to load.
- The report and the project description are in greek so if you dont understand you can still look at the code that has a good level of explanation inside.
- In the experiments folder we have all the algorithms run 1000 same games (in each experment diffenet 1000 games) and produces some data like histograms to see how good the algorithms are.
