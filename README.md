# Game-Theory--Finding-Approximate-Nash-Equilibria
 In this program we use various algorithms (DMP, DEL, FPUNIFORM, FPPBR) to find the aproximate nash equilibria in a random game generated by the program. The user can either choose to create the games from the beginning or to load them into the program (by having the payoff matrices for the row and column player in the path). He can also run all the algorithms or each one alone and produce in the end the eps approximate and eps well supported to see if the algorithm or algorithms were successful and how much.
